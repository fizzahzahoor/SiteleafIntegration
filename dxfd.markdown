`This service concentrates on managing the contractual relationship between you and the builder. It is recommended for clients who are undertaking simpler, smaller projects. Contract administration is often chosen by clients who have the time to be closely involved with their build but want the added reassurance of expert project oversight.

We will come to site at valuations visits only (typically once every two weeks) and inspect the building works.  We will issue minutes of the meeting and a programme statement.  We will also check the invoice that the contractor has raised to see that it tallies with the work completed on site and the price previously agreed.  We will then issue certificates for payment as required under the contract.`
