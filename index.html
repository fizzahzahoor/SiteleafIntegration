                            <p>I first hired Akiva Projects to carry out a vast array of works in the installation of a new kitchen at my home. This included gutting the kitchen, re-flooring, moving pipes and electrical fittings all over the place, re-plastering, painting, and assisting in the fitting and installation of the new kitchen and its appliances. Beyond these initial works, during which I was impressed by the work carried out by the team, I hired them for subsequent works at my home, such as changing the electrical fuse-box/board of the flat, fixing an on-going electrical failure problem, as well as plumbing and tiling works at our bathrooms.</p>
                            <p>I am 100% satisfied with the vast spectrum of works carried out by the team at Akiva Projects; they are professional, knowledgeable and committed to providing the highest quality of service possible. Best of all, they keep you fully informed and updated on all aspects of the works throughout the process, and most importantly, I trust them, to the extent where the team has a spare key to my property at all times.</p>

                        <p>We’ve dealt with a number of different tradesmen over the years whilst renovating our property and I’d have to say that James has been the easiest to deal with, communicating clearly what would happen when and responding to all our requests. We’d be happy to use Akiva Projects again – I highly recommend James and his team.</p>
                        <p>James and his team fitted our kitchen (including plumbing and electrics), tiled the floor and walls, filled in an old doorway and decorated the kitchen area. We were very impressed with the standard of work throughout. James was very responsive and prompt from the outset. The specialist tradesmen he works with are all of a really high standard and we are so pleased with the finished kitchen. They dealt really well with the fact that none of the walls/floor in our Victorian house are square and suggested solutions to the problems encountered as a result of this to ensure that the finished kitchen looked great.</p>
